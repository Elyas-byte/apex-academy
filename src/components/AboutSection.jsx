        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          At Apex Jiu-Jitsu Academy, our curriculum is designed to offer clear and accessible insights into the theory and techniques of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. We emphasize the importance of grappling in real combat situations while recognizing the need to adapt techniques to individual body types and reactions.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Our structured progression guides students from white belt fundamentals—focusing on basic positions, escapes, and self-defense—through to black belt mastery with advanced techniques, variations, and no-gi grappling. Each belt level builds upon the last, developing not just technical skills but strategic thinking and personal growth.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
          We promote continuous learning and development for both students and instructors, fostering an environment where everyone can evolve their practice while honoring the rich history and philosophy of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
