        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>Team Apex</strong> (<a href="https://apexacademybh.org/" className="text-red-600 underline">apexacademybh.org</a>) is founded on the belief that martial arts is a powerful tool for personal development and leadership. 
          Our mission is to cultivate confidence, discipline, and strategic thinking through a structured and engaging training environment.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          We offer a specialised martial arts program for younger students, divided into two age groups: <strong>Junior Leaders (ages 8–12)</strong> and <strong>Senior Leaders (ages 13–16)</strong>. 
          This curriculum, known as <strong>MuJitsu</strong>, blends techniques from Muay Thai, Boxing, Judo, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to create a complete system focused on physical ability, mental sharpness, and emotional resilience.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          At Team Apex, training goes far beyond self-defence. Students learn to think critically under pressure, regulate their emotions, and lead with composure. 
          Jiu-Jitsu is often described as “physical chess,” and our approach develops adaptability, focus, and creative problem-solving on and off the mats.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The benefits extend beyond physical fitness. The dynamic and strategic nature of Jiu-Jitsu enhances brain function, supports calmness under stress, and strengthens decision-making—skills that translate directly into academic and personal success.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
          <strong>Team Apex</strong> honors the traditions of martial arts while embracing modern, evidence-based teaching methods. 
          Every student is encouraged to evolve physically, mentally, and emotionally—becoming not only skilled martial artists but also confident, capable, and composed leaders.
